## What is Scope?
The scope is the part of a computer program where an item that has an identifier name is recognized. Items with an identifier inclue variable, constants and functions.
## What is Hoistig?
Hoisting is a mechanism in Javascript where variables and function declarations get moved the top of their scope before the code gets executed.
This ensures that no matter where a function or variable gets declared, it gets moved to the top of its scope whether that scope is 
global or local.
## In what cases might you use let cs const vs var?
The var variable can be updated and redeclared within its scope. I would use var for a variable that gets used often and undergoes complete, radical changes. Let variables can be updated but not redeclared. I would use let for a variable that changes, but doesn't need to be re-declared. Const variables cannot be updated or redeclared. I would use const for a variable that I don't want to change at any time.
