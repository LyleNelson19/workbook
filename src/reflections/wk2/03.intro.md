# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
One way is to right click, inspect, and then see the console, which shows you any errors. I would do that when
something went wrong and I want to troubleshoot my code. Otherwise, I would simply write my code to the file page.
# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
That would be right click and then inspect. Doing this will allow you to see any erros you may have.
# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
You can use the debugger statement. If you don't need to see errors, this my be a quicker way to debug code.
