# What are three ways to sytntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts(if any)
# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are named variables passed into a function. Arguments are the values passed into the function whenever it's invoked.
# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Higher order functions are those that takes one or more functions as an argument and/or returns a function as its result. Here's an example
straight form my Moon Miner Project.

let cheese = 0
function mine(){
    cheese += 1+rate
    update()
}
function update(){
    document.getElementById("stats").innerHTML=`<h1>Cheese Count: ${cheese}</h1>`
}
