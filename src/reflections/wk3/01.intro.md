# What problems does using exports solve?
Using exports allows you to export objects, functions, or primitive values form one module and use them in other programs. This is essential if you are building an app that uses the MVC pattern.

# How does export differ from export default?
Export requires a name declaration and export default does not. There can only be one default export per module.

# What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The Module systems gives more cultivation and flexibility of individual profiles. This is because it makes the given choices more combinable.
