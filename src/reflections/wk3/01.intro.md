# What problems does using exports solve?
Using exports allows you to export objects, functions, or primitive values form one module and use them in other programs.

# How does export differ from export default?
Export requires a name declaration and export default does not. There can only be one default export per module.

# What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The Module systems gives more cultivation and flexibility of individual profiles. This is because it makes the given choices more combinable.
